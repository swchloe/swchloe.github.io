		As you land in LAX, the first thing that greets you in the airport is the American flag. The amount of flags being flown around rivals the number of Starbucks round the corner. It will be a short weekend trip in the City of Angels before heading up to Northern California.

		If you're visiting LA without a vehicle, metro would be your next best choice. Some form of skateboard would also work and you won't feel like the odd one out as most of the population go around on boards.
		</p>
		<p>It would be easier to go around LA once you've broken them down into different blocks of neighbourhoods. Each area would gladly take half a day if you're keen on visiting all the architecture sites they have to offer. There are 3 major tourist areas to visit in LA: the Central LA,Downtown LA and the Westside.</p>

		<h2>Central LA</h2>
		<p>Central LA is where you will find both Hollywood Boulevard and the Sunset Boulevard. As the pavements are nicely done with terrazzo (polished concrete with chips of either marble or granite) they make for a very smooth surface to skate on.</p>

		<h2>Downtown LA</h2>
		<p>Making my way downtown, downtown LA is no doubt the CBD of the county. Here you will more office workers than any other part of LA. There are a few interesting sites to see in this part - concert halls, contemporary art museums and so much more to offer.</p>

		<h2>Westside</h2>
		<p>Getting on a bus heading West takes you right by Santa Monica. There should be a thing to be aware of is when the peak times are as it could take you more than 2 hours to travel a little just over 10 miles in the bus during rush hour.</p>
